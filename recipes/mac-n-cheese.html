    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This perfect baked macaroni cheese recipe comes with a creamy cheese sauce, a hint of mustard and uses leftover
        French stick for its crunchy topping</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>50g baguette</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>350g spiral or other short pasta</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 tsp English mustard</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>500ml whole milk</li>
        <li>250g vegetarian mature cheddar</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Spread the baguette chunks over a baking sheet, drizzle with the melted butter and season. Bake for 6 mins until crisp, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta for 2 mins less than stated on the pack, then drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the garlic and English mustard powder, cook for 1 min, then stir in the plain flour.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1 min more, then gradually whisk in the milk until you have a lump-free sauce.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 5 mins, whisking all the time until thickened. Take off the heat, then stir in the cheddar and half the parmesan.</li>
        <li>Stir the pasta and some seasoning into the cheesy sauce. Tip into a large ovenproof dish, or four individual dishes.</li>
        <li>Scatter over the bread and the remaining parmesan, then bake for 20 mins until crisp and golden. Can be frozen before baking â€“ defrost thoroughly before cooking.</li>
